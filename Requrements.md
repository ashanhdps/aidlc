# Description: 
    a digital platform that helps organizations set, track, and evaluate employee goals, provide ongoing feedback, conduct reviews, and support professional development.
##	Features

### KPI Definition & Assignment

Managers/HR define role-specific KPIs with targets, weights, measurement frequency (daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly), and data sources. KPIs can be auto-suggested by AI based on job title and department benchmarks. Cascading logic: Company KPIs → Department KPIs → Individual KPIs.

### Real-Time KPI Dashboard

Employee and manager view: live progress bars, gauges, trend charts, and traffic-light coloring (red/yellow/green). Automatic data pull via integrations (Salesforce, Zendesk, SAP, Google Sheets, Power BI, custom APIs, etc.).

### Performance Reviews

Structured reviews built around KPI achievement % plus behavioral competencies. Configurable templates: e.g., 70% KPI results + 30% values/competencies. Includes self-assessment vs. manager scoring with calibration tools.

### Continuous Feedback & Recognition

Real-time feedback tied directly to specific KPIs (“Great job hitting 98% CSAT this week!”). Peer recognition with monetary/non-monetary rewards linked to KPI impact. Slack/Teams bot for instant kudos.


### KPI Guide Questions & Coaching Database

Managers (or AI) provide suggested coaching questions tied to each KPI. Example for “Sales Revenue” KPI: 
• “What worked best this month in closing deals?” 
• “Which obstacles prevented you from hitting 100%?” 
AI instantly generates or improves questions from the KPI description.

### AI-suggested KPIs

AI can suggest KPIs for HR but it needs HR approval 


### Personas

Executive Managers (CEO, COO, Senior management team) - view reports and statistics of how teams are performing
Employees - see KPI library assigned to them. perform self-evaluation and view their current performance 
HR - they will set KPIs per individual employees. view reports. HR can approve KPI changes
Supervisors - they set the KPIs of employees in case there are modifications from the HR-set KPIs
